# R_Analysis
Module 15 of UofT Data Analytics Boot Camp

## Overview
To provide the technical reports based on the results of mpg testing and suspension coil testing for the MechaCar, AutosRUsâ€™ newest prototype.

#### Objective
* Create the multiple linear regression model that represents mpg of the MechaCar and determine the factors that contribute to mpg
* Calculate basic statistics metrics and perform t-test of the weight capacity of Suspension Coils to determine that the manufacturing data meets the design specification
* Make suggestion for further development

#### Resource
* Software / Programming: R, R Studio, Jupyter Lab
* Data Source:
    1. MechaCar_mpg.csv
    2. Suspension_Coil.csv

## Results
#### MPG 
The result of statistical metrics calculated based on multiple linear regression model is as shown below.

The results indicate that;
* As coefficients of each independent variables are not zero, the slope of the linear model is not zero.
* Spoiler angle and presence of ADW are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model.
* Although the r-squared value of 0.71 indicates that model describes the current dataset well, low p-value of all individual variable suggests that the model will likely not represent the future data.

#### Suspension Coil
Two tables and a image below show the summary statistics of the capacity test of the suspension coils and the result of one sample t-test. 
The results indicate that;
* Although overall variance is lower than the design specification of less than 100, the variance of Lot3 is clearly above the design value.
* Compliance to design specification is extremely important for the car industry as the failure of the car could lead to a tragic accident and therefore strict significant level (0.001) should be applied.
* Result of t-test shows p-value of 0.03, which means that the mean of the samples are statistically different from 1500.
* Therefore the suspension coils are not meeting the design capacity and it is strongly suggested to review the manufacturing process, especially the issue that may have occured during lot 3.
* Note one sided hypothesis is used for t-test as having a suspension with higher capacity will not cause any significant issue.
